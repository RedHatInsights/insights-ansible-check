For both RHEL6 and RHEL7

    From:
      https://access.redhat.com/solutions/137833 (How can I make RHEL 6 or RHEL 7 FIPS 140-2 compliant? )
      
    yum install dracut-fips

    Dracut needs the path to the image file, and the version number of
    the kernel.  By default Dracut uses the current running kernel's version,
    and a default location for the related initrd

    Prelink modifies the current running root device.
    
    But grubby modifies the boot configuration (kernel, initrd, and root
    device) for what WILL be booted next time the machine boots that grub
    configuration.

    On a typical RHEL/Fedora installation stuff will just work out most
    of the time, but things go wrong if there is a mismatch between what
    prelink and dracut modify, and the grub config entry that grubby modifies.
    The simplest way this can fail is if a new kernel gets installed, but
    before we reboot into that kernel, fips-mode script runs, which modifies
    the new grub entry, but the initrd file and kernel version of the still
    currently running kernel.  

    Because of the way we do prelink on the current root device, we need to
    make sure the the grub entry we change is the same as the root partition
    of the current root device.

    Because of the way we do reboot which will reboot the default grub entry,
    we need to modify that.  OR we need to build a new grub entry and make
    that the default.

    First pass try at this:

    Only modify the default grub entry.

    Check that root device specified in grub entry is current root device,
       fail playbook if not.

    Check that current kernel version matches kernel and initrd entries
    in grub entry, fail playbook if not.

    It would be possible to tell dracut
    to modify the initrd using the kernel version and initrd information
    from the grub entry.  The kernel version you pass to dracut must
    be a directory in /lib/modules.  The kernel version is in the name
    of all kernels shipped by RH.  The kernel version is available from
    'file' on the kernel.img.  The kernel version is available from
    'mkimage -l'.







        

    



    Optional:
       grep -qw aes /proc/cpuinfo && echo YES || echo no
       if the above == 'YES':
         yum install dracut-fips-aesni

         if this command returns (on RHEL6 this returns) "No package dracut-fips-aesni available"
            if the optional server or workstation repo is not enabled

         yum-config-manager --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms --enable rhel-6-workstation-optional-rpms
         yum install dracut-fips-aesni


         rpm -q prelink && sed -i '/^PRELINKING/s,yes,no,' /etc/sysconfig/prelink
         rpm -q prelink && prelink -uav

         #Backup and rebuild the current initramfs
         mv -v /boot/initramfs-$(uname -r).img{,.bak}
         dracut

         # add fips=1 and boot=<boot partition> to default boot cmd line
         # FIXME:
         #   note that the current kernel and the default boot kernel might be different
         #   and we should deal with that better
         grubby --update-kernel=$(grubby --default-kernel) --args=fips=1
         uuid=$(findmnt -no uuid /boot)
         [[ -n $uuid ]] && grubby --update-kernel=$(grubby --default-kernel) --args=boot=UUID=${uuid}

         reboot

         After the reboot:

         sysctl crypto.fips_enabled
         # should print '1'
         

For RHEL6:

I was originally working from <below>:
    but then i found 
      https://access.redhat.com/solutions/137833 (How can I make RHEL 6 or RHEL 7 FIPS 140-2 compliant? )
      https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2422061 (How to disable FIPS mode in RHEL 6 or RHEL 7 )

     also see:
      https://access.redhat.com/solutions/303333 (Is version X of Red Hat Enterprise Linux FIPS 140-2 certified/validated/compliant? )

     my first attempt at this (using instructions below) ended in
        https://access.redhat.com/solutions/335853  (Kernel panic after making Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 FIPS 140-2 compliant. )
        Though i don't think i had the boot=parameter wrong.
        
        I used vmm to get to the console, and edited the kernel command line to remove fips=1
        then tried again using the above instructions.
        Somehow i ended up with an empty grub.conf, which i decided not to try to fix, so just
        deleted the vm

        Next I'm trying to redo the above instructions, using rhel-6.5, centos-6, and fedora-??


        

I was originally working from:
  https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Security_Guide/sect-Security_Guide-Federal_Standards_And_Regulations-Federal_Information_Processing_Standard.html

  This guide states:
     Should you require strict FIPS compliance, the fips=1 kernel option needs to be added
     to the kernel command line during system installation so that key generation is done
     with FIPS approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place. Users should
     also ensure that the system has plenty of entropy during the installation process by moving
     the mouse around, or if no mouse is available, ensuring that many keystrokes are typed. The
     recommended amount of keystrokes is 256 and more. Less than 256 keystrokes may generate
     a non-unique key. 


Check that within /etc/sysconfig/prelink:
  PRELINKING=no

if it is not == 'no' (it should be 'yes', but need to check what effective values of this are (see man page, or scripts)
  then

(it would be nice if there was a way to determine if any libraries are prelinked
(or not in fips mode) without installing prelink -- look at the prelink command esp if it
is a script, and look at what dracut-fips installs and does to check FIPS mode)
if prelink package (prelink command is not installed:
    install prelink command
run prelink -uanv to see if any libraries are prelinked
     -u un-prelink
     -a all
     -n dry-run (don't actually do anything)
     -v verify show output
if there are any libraries shown
     run prelink -ua




yum install dracut-fips
     This enables FIPS integrity verification:
      FIPS integrity verification is performed when the dracut-fips package is present on
      the system, regardless of whether the system operates in FIPS mode or not. However,
      the integrity verification results are ignored (or only logged) if the system
      or a shared library is not in FIPS mode, even when dracut-fips is present. 

dracut -f
   This rebuilds the initrd
