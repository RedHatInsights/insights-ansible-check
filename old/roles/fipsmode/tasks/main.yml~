  # The following modifies the system such that next time the system boots, it will
  # be in fips mode.  Currently we are not testing if the "next reboot" is already
  # set up to go into fips mode, we just assume that if we are already in fips
  # mode, we don't care about the state of the next reboot.  Possibly a bad assumption.

  # But we should care about the state of the next reboot.  First off, because it could
  # be a wrong assumption, and the script could do-unexpected-things.  But more importantly,
  # our purpose here is to run well in --check mode.  In --check mode, these unconditional
  # calls to grubby and dracut commands are just skipped, meaning --check mode don't tell
  # us anything.

  # If we are not already in fips mode, then we unconditionally try to set things up
  # so the next reboot is into fips mode.

  # There are a number of ways this can go wrong.
  # Before running this playbook, ensure that the system was booted from the current
  # default boot entry.  The most common way for this to not be true is when a new
  # kernel version has been installed, but the system has not yet been rebooted into
  # that kernel using it's new default grub entry.
  #
  # The following assumes the default grub entry, the entry that will be used for
  # the next reboot, is the same entry that was used for the current boot.
  # If the root device differs, then the following un-prelinking is working on the
  # wrong root device.  If the kernel version differs then the following rebuilds the
  # wrong initrd, and modifies the wrong grub entry.

  # The following should be modified to do the following:
  # Find the current default grubby entry.
  # if it is already set up for fips mode, do nothing else
  # otherwise,
  #   if the kernel version to be booted IS NOT the kernel we are running now, fail with message.
  #   if the root device to be booted IS NOT the current boot device, fail with message
  #   otherwise
  #     continue with all of what are doing below except for the grubby command
  #        which shoud be changed to --update the default entry, rather than the ones with the
  #          given kernel version

  # It might also make sense for us to create a new grubby entry with fips mode, rather than
  # change the current one.
  #
  # We should (possibly?) also be setting the default kernel parameters in grubby.conf
  #
  # We should (possibly?) also be installing prelink, and then uninstalling it, to look for
  # and unprelink, and prelinked DSOs. Or we should find another way to test for the existance
  # of prelinked DSOs (there must be one, i just don't know what it is off the top of my head).
  #
  # We should build and use grubby, dracut, and sysctl modules (or similar) that work well in
  # --check mode.  There currently is no grubby or dracut modules, and the sysctl module does
  # not work well for crypto.fips_enabled in --check mode because of the read-only nature of
  # crypto.fips_enabled.
