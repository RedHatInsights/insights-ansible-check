# This playbook does an end-to-end test of ./insights-ansible-check on each target host.
#
# This playbook only works on RHEL 6 and 7.
#
# This playbook assumes it is being run from within the insights-ansible-check git repo.
#
# The insights-ansible-check script has two prerequsites that don't typically exist on
# RHEL6 and RHEL7 hosts: ansible and python-requests. Installing these prerequsites is
# not as easy as 'yum install', so we have created some shell scripts to install them.
# A main goal of this playbook is to test these scripts. 
#
# In addition to the target hosts, this playbook requires that an additional host exists
#   and is reachable from each target host by ansible through ssh.
#   The name of this additional host is specified as an extra variable to this script,
#   named 'checkhost':
#
#    ansible-playbook -l $NAME -e checkhost=gavin-rhel66-nofips tests/system_tests/test-in-repo.yml
#
#
# For each target host:
#   * remove any existing prerequsites using ansible modules
#   * rsync the git repo to the target host
#   * install the prerequsites using installation scripts in the repo to test these scripts
#   * run ./insights-ansible-check against 'checkhost'
#   * print out the results (this should be improved)
