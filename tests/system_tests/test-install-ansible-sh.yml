# This playbook tests the Ansible install shell scripts within this repo on each target host.
#
# This playbook only works on RHEL 6 and 7.
#
# This playbook assumes it is being run from within the insights-policy-check git repo.
#
# The insights-policy-check script has two prerequsites that don't typically exist on
# RHEL6 and RHEL7 hosts: ansible and python-requests.  Installing python-requests is easy,
# but installing these prerequsites is not as easy as 'yum install', so we have created
# some shell scripts to install them.  The main goal of this playbook is to test these scripts. 
#
# For each target host:
#   * Uninstall the things that the install script installs
#   * rsync the git repo to the target host
#   * run the ansible install script
#   * run ./insights-policy-check
#   * print out the results (this should be improved)
#
