# This playbook tests that the ./insights-policy-check script works from the
#    git repo on each target host.
#
# This playbook only works on RHEL 6 and 7.
#
# This playbook assumes it is being run from within the insights-policy-check git repo.
#
# This playbook assumes that insights-policy-check's prerequisites have been installed:
#   ansible
#   requests
#
# In addition to the target hosts, this playbook requires that an additional host exists
#   and is reachable from each target host by ansible through ssh.
#   The name of this additional host is specified as an extra variable to this script,
#   named 'checkhost':
#
#    ansible-playbook -l $NAME -e checkhost=gavin-rhel66-nofips tests/system_tests/test-in-repo.yml
#
# For each target host:
#   * git clone the repo
#   * run ./insights-policy-check against 'checkhost'
#   * print out the results (this should be improved)
#
