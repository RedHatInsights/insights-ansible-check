Use this demo to promote the idea of useing --check mode for itself,
  and for enhancing --check mode to support that usage




  
insights' customers wanting their own custom rules

difficulties of custom rules

   security issues mean we have to run rules on customer's systems
     and ship the results to Insights

   customer may have to learn Python

   customer must learn our rules writing framework


Ansible Playbooks as Custom Insights Rules

   while thinking about Insights x Ansible, we asked ourselves,
      Could custom Insights rules just be Ansible playbooks run in --check mode

   run the playbooks in --check mode, send the results to Insights,
      and interpret any "changed" results as "rule hits"

   playbooks already run on customer's systems

   customer may have to learn Ansible, but at least it's not
      a single use skill



Initial Working Sketch 

   new Insights service endpoint for uploading playbook results

   new Ansible callback plugin to collect, interpret, and upload results

   new "check" module so fact checks can be interpreted like module checks

   new command 'insights-ansible-check' to make it easy to run playbooks
     in --check mode with the plugins enabled



Ansible --check mode Enhancement

   this is just the beginning

   want to enhance *Ansible's* --check mode, not build an Insights Mode

       we choose Ansible because it's general purpose,

   Automated "checking" has become a topic

       Chef Inspec and OpenScap

   Any enhancements Ansibles --check mode will also help the Insights case
